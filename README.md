# Computer Network Inventory Portfolio Project
I would like to develop a computer network inventory web application that keeps track of network devices that are up and operational in a production network. Each device will have a list of attributes in which describes its capabilities. 

In a production network, devices are located in network closets. Those network closets are identified as either a IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame), MDF (Main Distribution Frame), or data center. Each network closet will be listed and associated to device on the network.  

In network closets, there are devices called UPS' (Uninterruptible Power Supplies) that assist with keeping networking equipment up during a building power failure. Network devices connect to UPS’ for redundant power and UPS’ are associated to a specific network closets.  

Network closets are associated to buildings on a campus computer network.

Being able to keep an inventory of this critical information will allow the networking team to have full knowledge of the network they're responsible for.
